        <h1>Drowsiness Detection and Alert System Using Deep Learning</h1>
    </div>

        <h1 class="heading1">Abstract</h1>
        <p class="para1">
            Driving requires full attention, and distractions like drowsiness greatly increase 
            the risk of accidents. Each year, approximately 1.35 million people die in road 
            traffic crashes, costing most countries 3% of their GDP. Our project aims to 
            detect driver drowsiness or other risky activities using Deep Learning models to 
            classify the driver's state from images.
            This project introduces a Drowsy Driver Detection System that uses Deep 
            Learning. It continuously monitors real-time data such as facial expressions, eye 
            movements, and vehicle dynamics. This information is used to recognize 
            patterns and extract features. The system is designed to fit seamlessly into 
            different vehicles and provides alerts (visual, auditory, and haptic) when it 
            detects signs of drowsiness. By focusing on simplicity and efficiency, the 
            system is both accessible and cost-effective, making it suitable for widespread 
            use in the automotive industry.

        <h1 class="heading1">Introduction</h1>
        <p class="para1">
            Drowsiness refers to a state of near sleep characterised by a strong desire to rest. 
            It has two distinct aspects: the habitual state that precedes sleep and the chronic 
            state, which occurs regardless of the daily rhythm. Drowsiness is particularly 
            hazardous when performing tasks that require continuous focus, such as driving. 
            When a driver feels excessively tired, they become drowsy, increasing the 
            likelihood of road accidents. Developing technologies to detect or prevent driver 
            drowsiness is a significant challenge in accident prevention systems.  
            Given the danger that drowsiness poses on the road, it is crucial to develop 
            methods to counter its effects. The goal of this project is to develop a simulation 
            of a drowsiness detection system. The focus will be on designing a system that 
            accurately monitors the state of the driver's eyes and mouth. By tracking these 
            indicators, early signs of driver drowsiness can be detected, potentially 
            preventing traffic accidents. Yawn detection is also a method used to assess 
            driver fatigue, as tired individuals frequently yawn to increase oxygen intake 
            before becoming sleepy. 
            <br>
            <br>

            Fatigue and sleepiness detection involves analysing a sequence of facial images 
            and observing the duration for which the eyes and mouth remain open or closed. 
            One effective method for detecting eye closure is PERCLOS, which measures 
            the percentage of time the eyes are closed over a specific period. Facial image 
            analysis, a popular research area with applications such as facial recognition and 
            human identification for security systems, is integral to this project. The project 
            focuses on the localization of the eyes and mouth within facial images, applying 
            image processing algorithms to determine their positions. 
            Once the system locates the eyes, it can ascertain whether the eyes and mouth 
            are open or closed, thereby detecting signs of fatigue and sleepiness. This 
            approach aims to provide an effective solution for monitoring driver alertness 
            and enhancing road safety.

        <h1 class="heading1">Working of Training Model</h1>
        <p class="para1">
            The system primarily focuses on detecting the driver's eye state (open or closed) 
            to determine if they are drowsy. This solution employs the OpenCV library, 
            which is renowned for its extensive computer vision functionalities, including 
            face and eye detection using pre-trained Haar cascade classifiers. 
            The program starts by importing the necessary library, cv2, which is the 
            OpenCV library in Python. OpenCV is extensively used for real-time image 
            processing and computer vision tasks. The Haar cascade classifiers used in this 
            code are pre-trained models included in the OpenCV library, which detect 
            objects in an image. These classifiers are based on the Haar feature-based 
            cascade classifier algorithm, introduced by Paul Viola and Michael Jones. 
            First, the code specifies the path to the Haar cascade classifier for detecting 
            faces. The classifier is loaded using the cv2.CascadeClassifier method, which 
            reads the XML file containing the pre-trained model. In this case, 
            haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml is used to detect faces. 
            Next, the code attempts to open a webcam for capturing live video. It tries to 
            access the default webcam (cap = cv2.VideoCapture(1)), and if that fails, it 
            attempts to access an alternative webcam (cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)). If the 
            webcam cannot be opened, an IO Error is raised, indicating that the webcam 
            cannot be accessed. 
            Once the webcam is successfully accessed, the code enters a continuous loop to 
            read frames from the webcam in real-time. Each frame captured from the 
            webcam is processed to detect faces and eyes. The eye detection is performed 
            using another Haar cascade classifier, haarcascade_eye.xml, which is 
            specifically trained to detect eyes. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Within the loop, the captured frame is converted to a grayscale image using 
            cv2.cvtColor. Grayscale conversion simplifies the image data, reducing 
            computational complexity and enhancing the performance of the detection 
            algorithms. The grayscale image is then processed to detect eyes using the 
            detect Multiscale method of the eye cascade classifier. This method returns a list 
            of rectangles where it believes it has found eyes in the image. Each rectangle is 
            defined by its top-left corner coordinates (x, y) and its width and height (w, h).
            For each detected eye, a Region of Interest (ROI) is created both in the 
            grayscale image and the color image. This ROI focuses on the detected eye 
            region for further processing. A rectangle is drawn around the detected eye in 
            the color image to visualize the detection.

        <p class="paragraph">
            The Drowsiness Detection and Alert System using Deep Learning is a 
            significant step forward in improving road safety. By employing advanced 
            machine learning and computer vision techniques, the system effectively 
            monitors the driver’s eyes and facial expressions in real-time to detect signs of 
            drowsiness. This project involves thorough data preprocessing, including 
            collection, cleaning, face and eye detection, resizing, normalisation, and
